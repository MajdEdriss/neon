  "description": "A component for rendering SVG images. These images are generally, but not limited to, <em>icons</em>. This component can render any SVG of any size. Size is not restricted in the NeonIcon component but rather in the components using the icons. Generally, when talking about icons, this component is only used to build other components. But you may also find it useful for rendering SVG images, e.g. illustrations.\n\nThere is an icon registry where strings containing SVGs can be registered with a name and that name can but used with the NeonIcon component to render the image. If the paths in the SVG are given the attribute <strong>fill=\"currentColor\"</strong> they will automatically take on the color provided to NeonIcon.\n\nThis provides the advantage of only registering the icons you actually need, dynamically switching colors in Typescript/CSS without using a large icon font and not having to duplicate icon images to support multiple color variations, including light and dark modes.\n\nFor more detailed information please see <a href=\"/design/icons\">Icons</a>.",
