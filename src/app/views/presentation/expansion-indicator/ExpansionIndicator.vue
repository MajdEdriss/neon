        <h1>Expansion Indicator</h1>
        <p>
          The <strong>NeonExpansionIndicator</strong> is a small animated chevron which is used by other components to
          indicate the expansion of a container. It's unlikely that it would be used on it's own but rather as part of
          creating a more complex component.
