        In future Neon will support multiple themes to suit a wider variety of tastes and styles (Note: for light and
        dark modes see
        <a href="/design/dark-mode">Dark Mode</a>). Each theme is available in both light and dark modes so you have the
        choice of light mode, dark mode or dynamically switching between the two.

        <strong>Note: </strong>It is recommended to only include a single theme is keep CSS includes to a reasonable
        size.
