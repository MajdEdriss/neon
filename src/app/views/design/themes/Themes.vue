        In future Neon will support multiple themes to suit a wider variety of tastes and styles (Note: for light and
        dark modes see
        <neon-link href="/design/dark-mode">Dark Mode</neon-link>). Each theme is available in both light and dark modes
        so you have the choice of light mode, dark mode or dynamically switching between the two.
      </p>

        <strong>Note: </strong>It is recommended to only include a single theme is keep CSS includes to a reasonable
        size.

        how to use themes.
